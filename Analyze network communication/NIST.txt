  Summary
A DDos attack was perpetuated, causing network resources start to failed, analyzing the network traffic log, 
the security team realize a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the companyâ€™s network through 
an unconfigured firewall

1. Identify
The incident management team conducted an audit of the systems, devices, and access policies implicated in the attack
to pinpoint security gaps. After analyzing network traffic, the security team reached a conclusion: a significant volume 
of ICMP data packets inundated the network. This surge in traffic was attributed to an unconfigured firewall, which ultimately 
allowed a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to the network.

2. Protect
The team implemented actions to prevent attacks on the near futurue, in complaince with the playbook provisioned by the security team, 
the next measueres were taken:
  A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
  Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
  Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
  An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics

3. Detect
The team proactively executed measures to thwart future attacks, aligning with the security team's prescribed playbook.
The following strategic actions were undertaken:
  Enactment of a novel firewall rule designed to curtail the influx of incoming ICMP packets, thereby constraining their rate.
  Implementation of source IP address authentication within the firewall infrastructure to meticulously scrutinize incoming ICMP packets for potential spoofed IP addresses.
  Deployment of sophisticated network monitoring software, instrumental in promptly identifying any anomalous traffic patterns that may arise.
  Integration of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), imparting the capability to selectively filter out ICMP traffic exhibiting suspicious attributes.

4. Response
The team initiated the establishment of a comprehensive firewall configuration registry. Alterations to firewall settings were enacted 
to proactively counteract IP spoofing. Additionally, a safeguard mechanism was implemented to automatically initiate server shutdown in 
response to the detection of unusual network traffic patterns through thorough analysis. These actions collectively enhance the organization's
ability to swiftly and effectively respond to potential security breaches.

5. Recover
Following the successful containment of the attack, the server underwent a reset. The security team will undertake a comprehensive review of  the backup file to ensure the integrity of data was not compromised. Additionally, the staff will be informed that any requests made prior to the incident were not logged or recorded. This proactive approach reinforces data security and transparency within the organization. In the future, external ICMP flood attacks can be blocked at the firewall.

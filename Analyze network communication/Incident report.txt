1. Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption
Reviewing the Wireshark log, the security team identifies an external IP (203.0.113.0) sending too many 
requests to the website server, causing a Zero Window problem. The security team also ensured that there 
were no other external IP contributing with the attack. The security team concluded that it consisted of a DoS attack.

2.Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction:
Due the server is receiving too many requests, it cannot process them all, this causes it to have an overload, 
so its response time takes too long, causing the following messages, the first one to the client: HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Time-out (text/html) 
error message and the second message in the log file: [RST,ACK].
As its name reflects, this type of attack blocks clients from establishing a connection to the server, so the consequences can affect 
production time. The security team proposes to configure the server's firewall to accept only requests from the local area, and not external ones.
